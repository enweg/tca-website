# Recursive


`Recursive` Identify reduced-form models using recursivity.

This class implements identification under a recursive
(Cholesky) structure, assuming conditional ignorability.

## Notes
- For SVARs, this corresponds to Cholesky identification.
- For LPs, it assumes conditioning on prior ordered variables.
- Commonly used in macroeconomics when contemporaneous shocks
are assumed to have a lower triangular impact.
