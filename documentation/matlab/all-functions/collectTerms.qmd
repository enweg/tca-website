# collectTerms


`collectTerms` Collect and sum multipliers for identical Boolean terms.

`qOut = collectTerms(q)` collects all terms $Q(b)$ where the Boolean statement
$b$ is the same and sums their multipliers. The result is a transmission
condition where each term appears only once, but with possibly different
multipliers (not restricted to Â±1).

## Arguments
- `q` (Q): A transmission condition. See also `Q`.

## Returns
- `qOut` (Q): A new transmission condition where identical terms have been
combined with summed multipliers.

## Example
```{.matlab}
q = Q({"x1", "x1"}, [1, 1]);
collectTerms(q)
% Output: Q({"x1"}, 2)

q = Q({"x1", "T", "x1"}, [1, 1, -1]);
collectTerms(q)
% Output: Q({"T"}, 1)
```
