# applyAndToB


`applyAndToB` Manipulate `B` and `Omega` to ensure var lies on all paths.

`applyAndToB(B, Omega, from, var)` modifies the matrices `B` and `Omega` such that
the variable indexed by `var` is present on all paths. This is achieved by:
- Zeroing out all edges going directly from the shock (indexed by from)
to any variables ordered after `var`.
- Zeroing out any edges going from variables ordered before `var` to any
variables ordered after `var`.

## Arguments
- `B` (matrix): Part of the system's representation.
- `Omega` (matrix): Part of the system's representation.
- `from` (integer): The shock index.
- `var` (integer): The variable index that must lie on all paths.

## Notes
- This function is intended for internal use only.
