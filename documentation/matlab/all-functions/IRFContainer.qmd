`IRFContainer` Container for storing impulse response functions.

This class holds IRFs, variable names, the originating model,
and the identification method used (if any).

## Properties
- `irfs` (3D array): IRFs with dimensions:
- First: Response variable.
- Second: Shock.
- Third: Horizon.
- `varnames` (cell array): Names of response variables.
- `model` (Model): Model used to compute the IRFs.
- `identificationMethod` (IdentificationMethod):
