# applyNotToB


`applyNotToB` Manipulate B and Omega to ensure var lies on no paths.

`applyNotToB(B, Omega, from, var)` modifies the matrices `B` and `Omega` such that
the variable indexed by `var` is absent from all paths. This is achieved by:
- Zeroing out the edge from the shock (indexed by from) to `var`.
- Zeroing out all edges from variables ordered before var to `var`.

## Arguments
- `B` (matrix): Part of the systems form.
- `Omega` (matrix): Part of the systems form.
- `from` (integer): The shock index.
- `var` (integer): The variable index that cannot lie on any paths.

## Notes
- This function is intended for internal use only.
