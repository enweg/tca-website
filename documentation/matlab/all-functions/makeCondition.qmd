# makeCondition


`makeCondition` Create a transmission condition from a Boolean string.

`q = makeCondition(s)` constructs a transmission condition $Q(b)$ from a
Boolean statement given as a string. The Boolean expression should use
variables of the systems form `x<num>`, where `<num>` represents a
variable index.

## Arguments
- `s` (string): A Boolean condition string where variables must be
represented using `x<num>`.

## Returns
- `q` (Q): A transmission condition.

## Example
```{.matlab}
s = "x2 & !x3";
cond = makeCondition(s);
```

## Notes
- Boolean conditions can include AND (&), NOT (! or ~), OR (|), and
parentheses.
- The resulting transmission condition can be used in `transmission` to
calculate the transmission effect.
