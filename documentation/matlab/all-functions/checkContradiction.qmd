# checkContradiction


`checkContradiction` Check for contradictions of the form `x1 & ~x1` (`x1 & !x1`).

`[hasContradiction, contradictions] = checkContradiction(varAnd, varNot)`
checks whether there is a contradiction where a variable appears in both
`varAnd` and `varNot`, meaning it is simultaneously required and forbidden.

## Arguments
- `varAnd` (vector or cell array of vectors): AND variable numbers obtained
from `getVarNumsAndMultiplier`.
- `varNot` (vector or cell array of vectors): NOT variable numbers obtained
from `getVarNumsAndMultiplier`.

## Returns
- `hasContradiction` (logical): True if any contradictions exist.
- `contradictions` (vector of logicals): A vector indicating which elements
yield a contradiction.

## Notes
- This function is used in `removeContradictions` to eliminate contradicting terms,
which helps speed up the simplification process by reducing the total
number of terms.
