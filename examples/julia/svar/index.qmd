Section 5.1 of @wegnerTCA2024 splits the effects of monetary policy into contemporaneous and non-contemporanous effects, the latter of which are linked to forward guidance and other non-conventional policies. In this example, we do the same. Before we begin, download both the [code](./wegner2025-section-5-1.jl) and the [replication data](./data.csv). Make sure to put the data and the code into the same folder.

To ensure a clean environment, we recommend starting a new Julia session. 

Next, add add the required packages to the environment. The following steps can be skipped if the packages already exist in the enrivonment. 

```{julia}
#| eval: false
] add TransmissionChannelAnalysis, DataFrames, CSV, CairoMakie, Makie
```

After adding the packages to the environment, load them: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=1 end-line=3}
```

Finally, before coming to the analysis, load the replication data into a `DataFrame`: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=5 end-line=5}
```

@wegnerTCA2024 do the analysis for two internal instruments of monetary policy shocks: (1) the @gertlerMonetaryPolicySurprises2015 instrument and (2) the @romerNewMeasureMonetary2004 instrument. We split our analysis accordingly and start investigating the contemporanous and non-contemporaneous effects of monetary policy estimated using the Gertler and Karadi instrument. 

## Gertler Karadi

@gertlerMonetaryPolicySurprises2015 derive an instrument for monetary policy shocks by extracting the surprise component of FOMC meetings from the change in Fed Funds Futures in a tight time window around these FOMC meetings. This instrument is contained in the data and named `mp1_tc`. Also contained in the data is the @romerNewMeasureMonetary2004 instrument (`rr_3`) which we do not currently need. 

To focus on the GK instrument, we filter the data for only the GK instrument, interest rates, output gap, commodity prices and inflation

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=11 end-line=12}
```

With the data at hand, our transmission channel analysis follows the common six steps. 

### 1. Defining the model

The first step to any transmission channel analysis is to define the model. Here, we will go with a VAR model. We include the instrument in the VAR, thus effectively deciding that we identify the shock via an internal instrument. 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=15 end-line=16}
```

### 2. Obtaining IRFs

Next, we obtain the total effects -- the structural IRFs -- by using the GK series as as internal instrument. We thus define our `InternalInstrument` identification method: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=20 end-line=20}
```

Structural IRFs can then be obtained by using `IRF` and providing the identification method. 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=23 end-line=23}
```

Although not strictly necessary, we normalise the shock's size to 25bps. This can be achieved by mutiplying the structural IRFs, currently normalised to a 1pp increase, by `0.25`.

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=24 end-line=24}
```

### 3. Defining the transmission matrix

The third step to any transmission channel analysis is the definition of the transmission matrix. @wegnerTCA2024 order the Fed Funds rate first, followed by all other variables. The implementation of internal instruments is slightly different here, requiring us to order the internal instrument first, followed by the Fed Funds rate, and all other variables. The transmission matrix can then be defined in the following way: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=27 end-line=27}
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
To be more general, the implementation of internal instruments, and specifically the computation of the Cholesky-orthogonalised IRFs needed for transmission channel analysis, is slightly different here than in @wegnerTCA2024. The final results will be qualitatively the same, although quantitatively slightly different.  
:::

### 4. Defining transmission channels

The fourth step is to define the transmission channels. @wegnerTCA2024 focus on two channels that perfectly decompose the effect. They define the contemporanous channel of monetary policy as the effect of monetary policy going through a contemporanous adjustment in the federal funds rate. They then define the non-contemporaneous channel of monetary policy as the effect of monetary policy not going through a contemporanous adjustment in the federal funds rate -- the complement of the contemporaneous channel. Note that according the Section 4.3 of @wegnerTCA2024 the effects through these channels are invariant to any re-ordering of inflation, commodity prices, and the output gap, as long as they are ordered after the Fed Funds rate. 

The non-contemporanous channel can be defined in the following way: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=30 end-line=30}
```

The contemporanous channel can be defined as the complement: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=31 end-line=31}
```

### 5. Computing transmission effects

Transmission effects can now be computed using `transmission`. We must provide our `InternalInstrument` identification method: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=34 end-line=38}
```

To double check whether everything worked, we check whether the two channels perfectly decompose the total effect. Very minor differences might exist due to numerical rounding. 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=40 end-line=40}
```

### 6. Visualising decomposition

Lastly, we visualise the decomposition using `plot_decomposition`. We must first define the channel names and collect all transmission effects into a vector: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=43 end-line=44}
```

The decomposition for the effects of a monetary policy shock on the federal funds rate (the second variable in the data) can then be obtained in the following way: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=45 end-line=45}
```

However, we are also interested in the effect on inflation. Instead of creating a separate plot for the federal funds rate and inflation, we can plot them into a single plot using `plot_decomposition!`. This requires a bit more work, but is also more flexible than the above method. 

To plot both variables into a single figure, we first create a figure: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=48 end-line=48}
```

Next, we create a new axis as position `[1,1]` in the figure. We plot the decomposition for the federal funds rate into this axis using `plot_decomposition!`. 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=49 end-line=50}
```

We do the same for the plot for inflation, with the differences that we this time plot the axis to position `[1,2`], thus to the right of the federal funds rate plot. 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=51 end-line=52}
```

Lastly, we add a legend below the two plots: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=53 end-line=53}
```

Figure XXX displays the final decomposition plot, showing both the decomposition of the total effect of a monetary policy shock on the federal funds rate and inflation.

## Romer and Romer

Most of the transmission channel analysis for the @romerNewMeasureMonetary2004 instrument follows the same steps as for the @gertlerMonetaryPolicySurprises2015 instrument. Below we highlight only the differences. For steps 2, 4, 5, 6, the same code as above can be used. 

Before we start, we must first adjust the data and replace the GK with the RR instrument: 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=63 end-line=63}
```

### 1. Defining the model 

Because the data has changed, our model definition changes slightly -- the dataset name changes. 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=66 end-line=67}
```

### 3. Defining transmission matrix

The transmission matrix remains largely the same, but the name of the instrument changes. 

```{.julia include="wegner2025-section-5-1.jl" start-line=78 end-line=78}
```

### 6. Visualising effects

While the code ramains the same, the graphs change.

::: {.callout-note} 
Minor differences between the decompositions here and the ones in the paper 
are due to how we obtain the Cholesky-orthogonalised IRFs. In the paper we estimate 
orthogonal IRFs using a VAR excluding the internal instrument. Here we 
include the internal instrument.
