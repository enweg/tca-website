In this example, we replicate the results from Section 5.3 of @wegnerTCA2024. Before we begin, download both the [code](./sw2007.m) and the [Dynare model](./SW2007.zip). Make sure to unzip the Dynare model, and place both the *sw2007.m* script and the *SW2007* folder into the same directory.

To ensure a clean environment, we recommend starting a new Matlab session. Alternatively, run the following lines to clear the workspace and console:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=2 end-line=3}
```

## Computing the Linearised DSGE using Dynare

Section 5.3 of @wegnerTCA2024 studies the wage channel of a contractionary monetary policy shock using the DSGE model of @smetsShocksFrictionsUS2007. To analyse this channel, we first obtain the model's first-order approximation using [Dynare](https://www.dynare.org). [Follow Dynare's official [installation instructions](https://www.dynare.org/manual/installation-and-configuration.html) if necessary.]{.aside}

To use Dynare and the TCA Toolbox, we first add both to the Matlab path. You will likely need to adjust the file paths in the quotation marks:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=6 end-line=9}
```

Assuming the *SW2007* folder is in the current directory, we can now generate the first-order approximation:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=12 end-line=15}
```

## TCA Setup

With the TCA Toolbox added to the path, we can create a `DSGE` model from Dynare's output structures:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=22 end-line=22}
```

TCA requires impulse response functions (IRFs) to decompose effects. We obtain them as follows, extracting the IRF array from the `IRFContainer`:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=29 end-line=31}
```

## Defining Transmission Channels

At this stage, we have the DSGE's first-order solution and the IRFs. We can now define the transmission channels of interest.

First, define the transmission matrix. Following @wegnerTCA2024, we order variables so that interest rates (*robs*) come first, wages (*dw*) second, and inflation (*pinfobs*) last. The ordering of variables between wages and inflation does not matter[^1]:

[^1]: See @wegnerTCA2024 for the theoretical justification.

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=38 end-line=38}
```

Next, we define the transmission channels. The demand channel is defined as the effect that does not pass through wages (*dw*) during any period from 0 to 20. We define this channel using the `notThrough` function:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=40 end-line=40}
```

The wage channel, capturing any effect through wages in at least one period, is the complement:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=42 end-line=42}
```

## Computing Transmission Effects

We can now compute the transmission effects using the `transmission` method of the `DSGE` model. We specify the shock (`em`), the transmission channel, the transmission matrix, and the maximum horizon:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=45 end-line=46}
```

The output has the same structure as the original IRFs, with variables appearing in their original order and adjustments made for the defined shock size.

## Visualising Transmission Effects

To better understand the transmission effects, we plot their decomposition. We first name the channels:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=52 end-line=52}
```

Next, identify the indices of the outcome variable (inflation) and the shock (monetary policy shock `em`):

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=53 end-line=54}
```

Then collect the transmission effects into a cell array:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=55 end-line=55}
```

Finally, create the decomposition plot:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=56 end-line=56}
```

The plot shows:

- Total effect (black scatter-line)
- Effect through the demand channel (blue bars)
- Effect through the wage channel (red bars)

## Using an Alternative Transmission Matrix

@wegnerTCA2024 also explore an alternative ordering, where wages are placed second to last. We define the new ordering as:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=66 end-line=66}
```

Transmission channels and effects are then redefined and recomputed:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=68 end-line=73}
```

The decomposition plot for the alternative ordering can be created as follows:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=76 end-line=80}
```

The resulting plot mirrors the previous setup, with the only difference being the transmission matrix. The black scatter-line and the blue and red bars retain the same meaning as in the previous plot: the black scatter-line shows the total effect, the blue bars represent the demand channel, and the red bars represent the wage channel.

## Comparing Transmission Effects of Different Transmission Matrices

We can place @fig-first-round and @fig-second-round side-by-side for comparison. As shown in @fig-dsge-decompositions, differences are minor:

A more precise comparison uses the `plotCompareDecompositions` function. The following code generates Figure @fig-plot-comparison:

```{.matlab include="sw2007.m" start-line=86 end-line=93}
```

Figure @fig-plot-comparison shows small but detectable differences, as predicted by theory.
